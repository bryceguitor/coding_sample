# Coding Sample
This repository contains the code used for the analysis in my writing sample, which applies the ARMA-GARCH framework to model daily and weekly Bitcoin log returns from 2017 to 2024. The code implements extensions of the GARCH framework to account for leverage effects and evaluates model performance using error metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
